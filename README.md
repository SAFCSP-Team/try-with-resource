**Problem**

Use the `try-with-resource` statement to read a file and perform a specific action.

**Implementation**

Using the provided `data.txt` file, do the following steps.
1. Create an instance of `FileReader`, and pass it as a resource object.
2. Use the `BufferedReader` class to read `data.txt` file content.
3. Print the content of `data.txt` file.

> Note: `try-with-resource` block is used to read the file and automatically close it once the try block is finished with execution.


  
```Java

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        try (FileReader fileReader = new FileReader("data.txt");
       }
}

```
